# Azure Basics

Being flexible is key to becoming strong DevOps engineer, so I have tried to apply concepts I have learnt for AWS
to Microsoft Azure, the second readme2 'Build' section contains the commands needed to deploy the sample application for Sparta via Azure which is a good introductory task in order to familiarise oneself with the service.

Note: When connection is REFUSED, this means the port is not listening nor configured properly for that port via nginx or apache, when the connection is TAKING TO LONG that means we likely have a security group or network ACL issue.
